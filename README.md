# Python-project
Project Overview

This project involves analyzing an employee dataset from ABC Company using Python.
The dataset consists of 458 rows and multiple columns containing employee details such as age, salary, position, and team.
The goal is to preprocess the data, perform statistical analysis, and present insights through visualizations.

Preprocessing Steps

1. Handling Missing Data – Checked for null values and handled them appropriately.

2. Data Cleaning – Ensured data consistency and corrected anomalies.

3. Height Column Correction – Replaced missing or incorrect height values with random numbers between 150 and 180 cm to maintain data integrity.
 
Analysis Tasks & Results

1. Employee Distribution Across Teams

Counted the number of employees in each team.

Calculated the percentage split of employees across teams.

Visualization: A bar plot showing the distribution of employees per team.

2. Employee Distribution by Position

Segregated employees based on job positions.

Visualization: A bar plot representing the number of employees in different positions.

3. Predominant Age Group

Identified the most common age group among employees.

Visualization: A histogram or bar plot of employee age distribution.

4. Salary Expenditure by Team & Position

Analyzed which team and position had the highest salary expenditure.

Visualization: Bar charts comparing total salary per team and position.

5. Correlation Between Age and Salary

Calculated the correlation coefficient (0.214) between age and salary.

This indicates a weak positive correlation (older employees tend to earn slightly more).

Visualization: A scatter plot showing the relationship between age and salary.
